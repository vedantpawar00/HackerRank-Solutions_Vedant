// A "Hello World" program has been widely adopted as the introductory program for learning how to code. So, let's start functional programming by writing the same program.

public class HelloWorld 
{
    static void fun()
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        fun();
    }
}
